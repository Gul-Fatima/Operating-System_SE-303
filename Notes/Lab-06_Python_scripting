'''3. Sequential Arithmetic: Follow these instructions and print the result after each step:
1. Assign a variable a to a starting value of 5.
2. Add 6 to the result.
3. Multiply the result by 2.
4. Increment the result by 1.
5. Subtract 9 from the result.
6. Divide the final result by 7. '''

print (a)

'''4. Disk Space Monitor: Write a Python script that monitors disk space on your system and prints a
warning if the usage is above 90%.
Hints:
You'll need to install a third-party library called psutil.
Open your terminal and run: pip install psutil
Use the following code snippet as a starting point:
import psutil
# Get usage statistics for the root directory '/'
usage = psutil.disk_usage('/')
# Get the usage percentage
percent_used = usage.percent
print(f"Disk usage is at {percent_used}%")
# Now, add an if statement to check if it's over the threshold'''
import psutil
usage = psutil.disk_usage('/')
perc = usage.percent
print(f"Disk usage is {perc}")
if perc > 20:
	print ("disk usage is above thres")
